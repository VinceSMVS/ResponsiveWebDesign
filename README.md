# Reacreation of the lego site

---

### A multi-page web project dedicated to Lego, with the intent to make it a 1:1 copy.
This project showcases a responsive website built to learn to use css expertly. It involves some JavaScript, but the emphasis is upon using css to introduce breakpoints, in an effort to make it responsive.

## Key Features & Functionality

This project demonstrates foundational front-end development skills through the implementation of:

* **Responsive Navigation:** A custom-styled, interactive **hamburger menu** designed for optimal user experience across various screen sizes.
* **Interactive Product View:** On the mosaic detail page, users can dynamically switch between **front and back views** of the Lego mosaic simply by clicking on the respective image thumbnails.
* **Engaging Sound Feedback:** A "like" button on the product page that plays a satisfying sound effect upon interaction, adding a subtle layer of user engagement.
* **Clear Information Architecture:** A structured layout with a consistent header and footer across multiple pages, including detailed information sections.
